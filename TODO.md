# TODO: Update Backend Database Connection to Local MongoDB

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update `server/config/db.js` to connect to local MongoDB at 'mongodb://localhost:27017/curalink'

## Notes
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally on your machine before testing.
- If connection fails, check MongoDB service status and logs.
